# Dot Net Testing Demo

The goal of this project is to give examples of different kind of testing in .Net projects. The theme of the demo project is a very simple banking system. The project can also be used as a stub or base for test tooling demos.

Currently the demo only includes xUnit tests for the very simple Account class. More tests will be added over time. Also, more information about the project will be added over time. Still in a very early stage!
